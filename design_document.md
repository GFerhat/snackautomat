# Project Goal

This is a Dart-based project that uses Flutter as the framework. The goal is to create a vending machine where the user can insert money and receive an item in exchange. It will have a centralized storage system based on Supabase, as well as a local database system to manage the money. The system will have two modes: the default state is the user mode (accessed by normal user), and the admin mode is accessed by inserting an admin card and entering the correct password. (admin is able to change the available procuts, restock and remove products).


## what you see on opening the app
when first opening the app the user sees a vending machine with all its available products in a grid format. The machine has a sidebar which has an "insert money" and "return money" button. The sidebar has also a coin & bill-slit, input field and a coin tray 
On the bottom is a section to take the bought item out.

### insert money

### return money

### click on procut to buy
